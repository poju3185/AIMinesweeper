## Minesweeper Rules

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player's goal is to uncover all cells on a rectangular grid without detonating any mines. Here are the basic rules:

1. **Objective**: Uncover all non-mine cells on the grid.
2. **Grid**: The game is played on a rectangular grid of cells, some of which contain mines.
3. **Numbers**: Each cell either contains a mine or a number indicating the count of mines in adjacent cells (including cells touching corners).
4. **Actions**: Players can uncover cells manually or utilize an AI to make moves.
5. **Safety**: Players can mark cells suspected to contain mines to avoid accidental clicks.
6. **Winning**: The game is won when all non-mine cells are uncovered.
